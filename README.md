## Description
This is just a place for me to list mathematics related programming ideas (visualizations etc)

## Visualizations
### Spectral Sequences
Roughly speaking (bigraded) spectral sequences can be pictured as occuring in this [3D complex](https://x.com/anisomorphism/status/1841320273372410367). I'd like to make something where you can click through the sequence and see the flow of data through the long exact sequence, have operations like page turning etc too. Build as a web app.

### Spherical Harmonic/Angular Momentum
In quantum mechanics the magnetic quantum number (thought of as angular momentum component along z-axis) takes 2n+1 values (n=total angular momentum). Classically there is no analog here, and thinking of particles as balls really doesnt help here. Rather they are 3 dimensional spherical waves. Hence the discrete z-components come from the different modes of the spherical waves (spherical harmonics). I'd like to build a tool that provides better physical intuition, and something to play with/plot the harmonics and compute them. 


## Blog posts
### Linear Systems theory and scattering theory
Hermannn touches on this briefly, there are strong analogs between linear systems and scarrering which should be explored more.

### Notes on mathematical control theory
To better understand the subject it'd be useful to write a post describing control theory from the differential geometric pov. Hermann does this but i find a lot of the material isnt develope past simple exaples --  the devil is often in the details etc etc.
